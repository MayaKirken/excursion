This is a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” I created this web page by using the guidance of a design mock and a redline mock provided by Codecademy to give me an idea of how I would implement the web page with HTML and CSS. I built this project because it gave me the opportunity to apply HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub to essentially get acclimated with sharing my work with other developers and deploying my web page to the world. My motivation was simply to show potential employers that I can conduct a project from scratch with little to no guidance and prove that I possess the toolkit for me to be able to collaborate and share with other developers. In addition to the languages that I used, I also used a video component, supporting text, and images that were provided to replicate the mock. Building this web page helped me solidify my confidence in using Git and GitHub to properly create a local repository by having me remember to commit my changes every chance that I get and not go ahead too many commits and become more comfortable with deploying my web pages to the World Wide Web.
